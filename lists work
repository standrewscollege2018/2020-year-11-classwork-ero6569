""" this program demonstraights how a list works, including how to price, change and append items """

fruit = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Kiwifruit", "Bananas"]


# To print an item from alist, we use the name of the list and its index (which starts at 0)
print(fruit[3])
# you can print out the entire list
print(fruit)
#lens(list()) gives the number of items in the list
print(len(fruit))

# to change an item, just use its index and set it directly 
fruit[0] = "Mago"
print(fruit)
# To insert an item at a specfic location, use insert()
fruit.insert(0, "Apples")
print(fruit)
# often it's easier to just add a new item to the end of list
# to do this, we use append()
fruit.append("Guava")
